# Game Studio Sub-Agents (Lion)

This project uses the [Game Studio Sub-Agents](https://github.com/pamirtuna/gamestudio-subagents) framework. When working on design, implementation, art, QA, or production tasks, consult the relevant agent files in `agents/`.

## Quick Reference

| Task | Primary Agent | PixiJS Variant |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Systems architecture, mechanics | mechanics_developer | mechanics_developer_pixi |
| Polish, juice, feedback | game_feel_developer | game_feel_developer_pixi |
| Shaders, VFX, optimization | technical_artist | technical_artist_pixi |
| UI/UX, interfaces | ui_ux_agent | ui_ux_agent_pixi |
| QA, testing | qa_agent | qa_agent_pixi |
| Design, GDD | sr_game_designer, mid_game_designer | — |
| Art direction | sr_game_artist | — |
| Market, analytics | market_analyst, data_scientist | — |
| Production | producer_agent, master_orchestrator | — |

## Engine: PixiJS

- **Stack**: PixiJS v8, TypeScript, Vite, @pixi/sound, @pixi/ui, motion
- **Config**: `engine_configs/pixijs_config.json`
- **Project config**: `project-config.json`

When an agent refers to Godot, Unity, or Unreal, substitute:
- GDScript/C# → TypeScript
- Scenes/Nodes → Container/DisplayObject hierarchy
- Signals → EventEmitter or custom events
- Tween nodes → motion library
- Control nodes → @pixi/ui components

## Usage

Before specialized work, read the relevant agent(s), e.g.:
- "Read agents/mechanics_developer_pixi.md and implement [feature]"
- "Read agents/sr_game_designer.md and agents/mid_game_designer.md, then design [system]"
